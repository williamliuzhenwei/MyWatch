This lab aimed at teaching us how to use Arduino, build up circuit on breadboard and communicate with MCU.
There are three challenges in this lab and each of them asked us to implement different goals.
Lab1_C1 is asking us to blink different LEDs at different frequencies. A delay function would work but I used clock time to 
set up the blinking frequencies. 
Lab1_C2 is asking us to build a counter that can count the time between start and stop. For this lab, when you push the button
the counter would start counting down and when you push it again, the counter would stop.
Lab1_C3 is basically the same thing compares to C2. C2 asked us count the time that passed, but this one is counting down. 
When you push the button, the timer will add 1 second, and after 3 seconds, the timer will start counting down. 
Whenever you push the button again, the timer will always add 1 second and wait for 3 seconds to start counting again.
