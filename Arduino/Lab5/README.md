This arduino code built up serial connection between MCU and laptop. Also, when it read the message 'wearable', 
it will start to let MCU send accelerometer data to laptop and stop when it reads 'sleep'. What's more, it will
print the steps on OLED based on the data sent back from MCU periodically which in my case is 5 seconds.
