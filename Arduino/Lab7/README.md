Challenge2: This arduino code built up serial connection between MCU and laptop. Also, when it read the message 'wearable', it will start to let MCU send accelerometer data to laptop and stop when it reads 'sleep'. 

Challenge3: For this one, the first function I did is that when someone press the button, the Red led will light up.(If it's powerful enough, we can use it as a torch). Then I let MCU to detect "BUZZ", it BUZZ is read, then the motor will buzz for 2 seconds to notice the wearer to move around. The last part is read message from the MCU. The MCU will return back time, temperature, steps and heart rate then print those on the OLED.
