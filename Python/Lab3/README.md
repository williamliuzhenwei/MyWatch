For challenge_1, I build different functions to call in the main function. The most important ones are regular_rule and reverse_rule.
The regular_rule translate English to pig_latin while the reverse_rule translate pig_latin to English. In main functions, I used multiple 
if-else loops to check edge cases and return the correct translation.

For challenge_2, it's similar to the pyserial tutorial, I built three functions to obtain the current time, date and weather information.
Then changed these variables to string, and push them to the OlED.
